The Sentinel-2 Global Mosaic service offers mosaic surface reflectance products derived from Sentinel-2 A and B platforms.
Input to the processing are the Level 2A products provided by the Copernicus Ground Segment, i.e. ESA Sentinel-2 core products.
The S2GM service generates regional and temporal composites at global scale and produced on-demand over specific areas of interest.
Mosaics consist of best representative spectra for given pixel location and compositing period, ensuring the consistency of spectra and thus the radiometric quality of the products.
Users of the Sentinel-2 Global Mosaic service benefit from a convenient configuration and request process in the Mosaic Hub,
the powerful user interface to the service, and the analysis-ready products, which allow for instant further thematic processing.

This manual enables new users of the Sentinel-2 Global Mosaic to fully exploit the capabilities of the service.
It contains a guide on the usage of :ref:`mosaic_hub`, an overview of the :ref:`mosaic_algos` used to generate mosaics, and a :ref:`prod_guide`,
which elaborates on content, format, and usage of the mosaics. In addition to this User Manual, expert users are referred to the
Algorithm Theoretical Baseline Document (ATBD) available on the `S2GM website <https://s2gm.sentinel-hub.com/node/3>`_.

For any questions that remain unanswered by this document or any other issues S2GM users are kindly
referred to the `User Support <https://s2gm.sentinel-hub.com/node/6>`_. We are keen to learn more about your experiences to
further improve the Sentinel-2 Global Mosaic service!
