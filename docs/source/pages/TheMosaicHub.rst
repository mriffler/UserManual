The Mosaic Hub
##############

The Mosaic Hub front-end is the main tool for S2GM users.
It allows to specify S2GM products in terms of the spatial extent as well as the compositing period
and the format of the output products.
The front-end guides the user through the process of this product specification.
A registration is required before requesting and downloading mosaics.

Mosaic Ordering
***************
This page describes the process of ordering  mosaics, from defining the conditions to the download of the processed product.
The ordering of :ref:`time_series` is described below.

Mosaic Hub
==========

The Mosaic Hub is located `here <https://webdev.sentinel-hub.com/mosaic-hub/#/>`_.

However, in order to download the processed products, you will have to install the "Mosaic Downloader" App.
In fact, this App has the same functionality like the browser instance. In order to avoid switching between browser and
Mosaic Downloader, it might be more convenient to work with the App from the beginning.


Mosaic Downloader
=================
In the Mosaic Hub, click on the drop-down menu item "Mosaic Downloader" like in :numref:`mosaicDownloaderMenu`.

.. _mosaicDownloaderMenu:
.. figure:: images/MosaicDownloaderMenu.png

   :align: center

   Mosaic Downloader Menu Item

From there, you are able to download the App for your specific OS, or even launch the App from the browser menu.
When you launch the App, you will see a window like in :numref:`mosaicDownloaderAppBase`.

The App Window is split with the dynamic map on the right and the temporal and spatial
configuration options on the left. Users can scroll and zoom into the map to focus on an area of interest.


Area Selection
--------------

.. _areaSelection:
.. figure:: images/AreaSelection.png

   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Area Selection
   :align: center

   Area Selection

As depicted in :numref:`Fig. {number}: {name} <areaSelection>`, there are different options to define the area for which the mosaic product will be generated:

.. .. todo::
   The shown warning does not say that the result will be split. Actually it says that the order will be reviewed. Requests are split if they are bigger then 10000 pixels. The review line is added when they are bigger then ???? pixels.
   By which rules are the requests reviewed? This could be explained to users.
   See: https://git.sinergise.com/s2gm/s2gm-hub/issues/62

* Drawing a rectangular or a polygon of arbitrary geometry on the map after selecting the corresponding icon in the menu on the upper right of the map (see :numref:`drawingTools`).
* Uploading a kml or kmz shape file. The upload button is located on the second tab in the area selection menu of the configuration menu.
* Selection of a pre-defined area, i.e. a country or a continent, in the dropdown menus of the configuration menu.
* Entering the area boundaries in WKT format (see :numref:`Fig. {number}: {name} <WKT>`.
  Note that in WKT the first and last co-ordinates must be identical to close the polygon.

Note that your product might be split into several tiles if it spans a large area (see also the warning displayed on :numref:`orderPanelOrder`).

Compositing Periods
-------------------
The definition of the compositing period is done in the temporal period section of the configuration menu.
There are five different compositing lengths to choose from: year, season, month, 10-day, day.
For each of these compositing lengths, pre-defined periods can be selected by choosing the desired option in the corresponding tabs.
Unavailable periods are disabled and marked in grey colour. In the 10-day and the day tabs, one can select months and years
from drop-down lists. The forward and backward scrolling can be done by clicking on the arrow symbol.

.. _compositingYear:

   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Compositing Dialog (Year)
   :align: center

   Compositing Dialog (Year)

As it can be seen in :numref:`compositingYear`, one can select a complete year as compositing period by clicking on it.

.. _compositingQuarter:

   :name: compositingQuarterName
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Compositing Dialog (Quarter)
   :align: center

   Compositing Dialog (Quarter)

Select a three-month period by clicking on the buttons Q1-Q4 (:numref:`compositingQuarter`).


.. _compositingMonth:

   :name: compositingMonthName
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Compositing Dialog (Month)
   :align: center

   Compositing Dialog (Month)

The selection of the desired month as compositing period is straightforward (:numref:`compositingMonth`).

.. _compositing10Days:

   :name: compositing10DaysName
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Compositing Dialog (10 days)
   :align: center

   Compositing Dialog (10 days)

The definition of a ten-days period is bound to pre-defined, fixed intervals.
The latter are displayed on the specific tab. Start- and end-days are marked in dark green,
the intermediate values in light green (see :numref:`compositing10Days`). Clicking on either day in the interval yields the same result.

.. _compositingDay:
.. figure:: images/CompositingPeriodDay.png
   :name: compositingDayName
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Compositing Dialog (Day)
   :align: center

   Compositing Dialog (Day)

The selection of the desired day as compositing period is straightforward (:numref:`compositingDay`).


Once the area of interest and compositing period have been selected, users must define further properties in the Order Panel dialogue.
Click on "**PREPARE DOWNLOAD**" to enter the Order Panel.


Order Panel
-----------
.. _orderPanel:

You will have to walk through four tabs and make your choices.
On the last tab, you will be able to resume your selections. In the first tab the data format has to be defined (see :numref:`orderPanelData`).

.. _orderPanelData:
.. figure:: images/OrderPanelData.png
   :name: orderPanelDataName

   Order Panel (Data format)

Make your choice and click on "**Next**". This brings you to the next tab of the Order Panel.
Here you can select the bands that shall be included in the product (see also :ref:`prod_guide`).
Apart from the surface reflectance bands, additional bands can be selected under "**Advanced Settings**" (see :numref:`orderPanelBands`).

   :alt: Order Panel (Band selection)
   :align: center

   Order Panel (Bands)

Click on "**Next**". The next page is used to assign a name to your specific order (:numref:`orderPanelOrder`).
Assign the name in such a way that it is as meaningful as possible. This way you will be able to distinguish your processings better later on.

.. _orderPanelOrder:
.. figure:: images/OrderPanelOrder.png
   :name: orderPanelOrderName
   :scale: 50%

Note that large orders might be split into several tiles. The Sentinel tile names will appear as subfolders in the
product when downloaded.

Click on "**Next**". You will get to the last page (see :numref:`orderPanelConfirmOrder`).
As mentioned before, you are now able to review your decisions and make changes if necessary.

If everything is correct, click on "**Generate**". The processing starts and after a while (depending on the size of the order)
you will be able to download your products in the :ref:`userArea`.

.. _time_series:

Time Series
***********

The definition of a time series is very similar to the definition of a mosaic.
A click on the button "**Time Series**" brings up the following page (see :numref:`timeSeriesDialog`):

.. _timeSeriesDialog:
.. figure:: images/TimeSeriesDialog.png
   :name: TimeSeriesDialogName
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Time Series Dialog Page
   :align: center

   Time Series Dialog Page

Fill out all sections of the dialog and select the target pixel(s) on the map. Klicking on the lower symbol toggles
between 1x1 and 3x3 pixels in the particular resolution (:numref:`timeSeriesPixels`). When done, click on "**Generate**".

.. _timeSeriesPixels:
.. figure:: images/TimeSeriesPixels.png
   :name: TimeSeriesPixelsName
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Time Series Pixels

Successful processing changes the "Generate" button into the following message (:numref:`timeSeriesGenerated`):

.. _timeSeriesGenerated:
.. figure:: images/TimeSeriesGenerated.png
   :name: TimeSeriesGeneratedName
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Time Series Generated Message
   :align: center

   Time Series Generated Message

Additionally, the pixels marked in :numref:`timeSeriesPixels` get a green border. Hovering over pixels will quickly display
their values and metadata; clicking on pixels will display the values on a page with the option to export data to a CSV file (:numref:`timeSeriesData`).

User Area
*********

Clicking on the button "**User Area**" in the Mosaic Hub App brings up the following dialog window (:numref:`userAreaImage`):

.. _userAreaImage:
.. figure:: images/UserAreaImage.png
   :name: userAreaImageName
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: User Area
   :align: center

   User Area

The User Area displays all current mosaic orders. You are able to filter for a production name to narrow your search.
If something went wrong, you can inform the S2GM team by clicking on the envelope icon. Orders can be cancelled by clicking
on the red cross icon. If the status of an order is finished, the download icon changes to green. Clicking on it will bring up the download dialog (:numref:`mosaicDownloaderList`). You first have to select a download directory that you can change later if needed.
Hovering the list will turn the entries from grey to black. A click on the black icon will finally start the download.

.. .. todo::
   How long will the order remain in the User Area? Add a column to show the date when it will be deleted?
   That's the corresponding issue: https://git.sinergise.com/s2gm/s2gm-hub/issues/62

   Mosaic Downloader List

As already mentioned above: if you selected a large area, the orders might be split into several tiles that appear in the
download list after you clicked on the download button. To avoid unnecessary processing on the Hub,
processings and thus the downloads will proceed only after user involvement. Also, you will be notified that more tiles
might be available (:numref:`moreTiles`). The red check mark signifies that the download isn't yet complete.
